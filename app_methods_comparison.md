## 🎯 **MY RECOMMENDATION**

For your school management system, I recommend:

1. **Test the PWA fixes first** (should work now)
2. **If still showing URL bar, use Capacitor** (best balance)
3. **For ultimate simplicity, use Android Studio WebView**

**All methods will create a true native app with NO browser elements!**
